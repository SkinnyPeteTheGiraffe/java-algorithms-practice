A random practice project I created as I brush back up on algorithms. I decided to use Java as it's my most comfortable 
language to develop in. I approached this project using TDD ideology, and in doing so have created unit tests for each 
implemented algorithm.

### Implemented Algorithms
 * #### Sorting
    * Insertion Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Quick Sort
